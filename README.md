### Introduction:

**In this project, we implemented a topic detection system on Twitter. This system reads tweets from a data stream, and assigns them to one of the existing clusters
or a new one. Each cluster acts as an agent, which makes the proposed approach a multi-agent system. There is also a coordinator, who monitors the whole system and 
coordinates the agent.The proposed approach has been experimented on two datasets:
The [COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/thelonecoder/labelled-1000k-covid19-dataset) and the [FA CUP](http://socialsensor.iti.gr/results/datasets/72-twitter-tdt-dataset). This project has been explained with greater detail in 
a paper, publicly available in [ComStreamClust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05349) .**

## System Overview

## How to use the code ? :hugs:

Data file must be a pandas DataFrame in pickle format having these columns : 

 - text
 - created_at
 - status_id

For example : 
![example](https://github.com/AliNajafi1998/ComStream/blob/tf-idf/data-example.png)

**warning: Data must be sorted based on created_at in ascending order**

## Requirements
   - pandas
   - colorama
