**In this project, we implemented a topic detection system on Twitter. This system reads tweets from a data stream, and assigns them to one of the existing clusters
or a new one. Each cluster acts as an agent, which makes the proposed approach a multi-agent system. There is also a coordinator, who monitors the whole system and 
coordinates the agents. This code has been written in python using several libraries such as ...... . The proposed approach has been experimented on two datasets:
The COVID-19 and the FA CUP. This project has been explained with greater detail in 
a paper, publicly available in ... .**

## System Overview

## How to use the code ? :hugs:

Data file must be a pandas DataFrame having these columns : 

 - text
 - created_at

For example :

**warning: Data must be sorted based on created_at in ascending order**
